# NgPerformance

Aim of this sample application is to showcase common performance related points to the developers.

This project was generated using [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 19.0.7.

## TODO

1. CDK example - div height and its container height issue
1. Material theme issue and material components look-n-feel (tab, input, button, etc)
1. Use `mat-card` wherever avoided earlier
1. Lazy modules example
1. Console error
   > SyntaxError: Unexpected token 'H', "Hello, ng-"... is not valid JSON

## Development server

To start a local development server, run:

```bash
ng serve
```

Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload whenever you modify any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Angular CLI includes powerful code scaffolding tools. To generate a new component, run:

```bash
ng generate component component-name
```

For a complete list of available schematics (such as `components`, `directives`, or `pipes`), run:

```bash
ng generate --help
```

## Building

To build the project run:

```bash
ng build
```

This will compile your project and store the build artifacts in the `dist/` directory. By default, the production build optimizes your application for performance and speed.

Angular CLI does not come with an end-to-end testing framework by default. You can choose one that suits your needs.
